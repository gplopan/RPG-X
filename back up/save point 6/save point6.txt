collisons work: rectagle.intersects(rectangle)

working on game over screen -> when the player dies the big screen closes and the small 
greeting screen comes back up with the gameover text and option to load or start but
the monster and the player work at double speed after loading or starting
greeting , gameView and board are singleton in order not to open more than one window or 
enter a loop of opening windows. 

greeting loading function had a signal loaded that doesn't allow it to call the function 
load() twice but that is not the issue with the double speed. thinking it is something related
to the fact that it was not disposed properly or that because there are more than one window
opened? this behaviour was also noticed when in trials for the game_over screen i managed to
open two gameview with the map loaded. both windows showed the same image, but they worked
at double speed if the player dies again, the speed triples in reference to the default and correct one. 

should try to set the board to null before re-loading. i think that it takes every input twice, 
once for the old one created in the beggining and the other for the new and visible window

other ideas:???
