leveling up still in the works. it is starting to shape up, although i am encountering the same issue
as before, with the speeding up of the player and monster

implemented reading the file configurations from the data base, that means level1, level2 have each a file
and a column in the db. the structure of the file is:
		level
		player stats(x,y,health, power, speed, score, shield, inventory(loads collectable objects)
		"enemy"
		enemy no
		enemy stats(filename, x, y, health, rockfile, sw, sh)
		"collectables"
		Map.loadPower : dinamically creates the powers array by reading from file and creating
new collectable objects. This means that when loading a game, you can't collect twice an object
		"interactable"
		Map.loadInteractable: dinamically creates the interactable array by reading from file
and creating new objects. this means that the objects that have been interacted will keep their state
(interacted and the right image showing)

issues in this saved version:
		loading the next file: at first the levels merge and only after that the map changes. 
speed is inceased twice for every load of the game, probably as a result of incorrect window management
		congratulations screen: it appears once the game wants to load a level that doesn't exist.
it will give the possibility to start over or load the last saved file, but those functions have issues.
can only load once as far as i tested. 
		when loading the next level, score and other stats reset to original values. 
		movement "moonwalking" bug has not been fixedd. 
		the indexoutofbounds error has been 
patched with a simple try/catch block, but i still don't know how to fix it.
